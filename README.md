# TowerDefence prototype
The project is the typical prototype of a tower defense game. The main idea is to build new towers and don't let enemies go into the main castle. The player gains a random count of gold (depended on the type of enemy) for each killed enemy. Enemies are spawned by waves. There is a special mechanism to create waves of enemies. Game designer can create waves with different amounts of specific types of enemies.

There are 3 types of enemies:
<ul>
<li>Skeleton</li>
<li>Orc</li>
<li>Grunt</li>
<ul>



Game designer can edit some characteristics of enemy as: Health, Damage, Attack frequency, range of gold for killing enemy.

There are four types of towers:
<ul>
<li>CannonTower - shoots with interval and kills enemies by cannonball.</li>
<li>GuardTower - allows players to buy new guards. Guards protect the area around the tower with a specific radius.</li>
<li>ArcherTower - kills enemies by archers.</li>
<li>MagTower - shoots with interval and kills enemies by magic fireball.</li>
<ul>
